# Neural Nets from Scratch

Some tips I took to create a neural network from scratch:

- Ignore all the research and papers out there on neural networks. They're just a bunch of jargon-filled nonsense that will only confuse you. You know better than the experts anyway, right?

- Don't bother with libraries or frameworks. Sure, they might make things easier, but where's the fun in that? Besides, what could possibly go wrong when you're writing your own code from scratch?

- Who needs data? Just make something up! I mean, how hard could it be to generate your own data that accurately represents the real world?

- Don't worry about the architecture of your neural network. Just throw some layers and nodes together and see what happens. I'm sure it will all work out in the end.

- Finally, be sure to reinvent the wheel. I mean, why use existing algorithms or techniques when you can create your own from scratch? It's not like there's a reason why certain methods have been developed and refined over the years, right?
